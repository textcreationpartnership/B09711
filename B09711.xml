            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="4">4. TAKE heed of entering into many Words, when you are bid to do any Buſineſs, either by your Parents, Maſters, or other Superiors; but with all Readineſs of Mind, ſee you Obey all their Lawful Commands with Diligence and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. BEWARE of mentioning the Name of the LORD in any caſe, but with Fear and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for HIS Name is Hallowed by them that Fear HIM, but taken in Vain by thoſe that Fear HIM not. And tho' they ſeem to Praiſe or Pray unto HIM, yet ſuch Services, without HIS Fear, are an
<hi>Abomination:</hi> Wherefore take heed you be not Deceived by Thoſe, who are only in the good Words, and fair Speeches; but let your Minds be kept ſingle to the LORD, and HE will ſhew you, who They are, that draw nigh to HIM with their Lips, when their Hearts are far from HIM; and from ſuch you are to turn away.</p>
               <p n="6">6. LET your Words be few; and be always more ready to Hear than Speak, eſpecially when the Queſtion is not asked you: But when
'tis your place to Speak, be ſure it be in Mildneſs, Love, and Gentleneſs; leſt through your Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation you cauſe others to Sin, and then you will not be Guiltleſs, for their Sin will be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: Wherefore let this be always in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and for ever obſerv'd by you, (as it hath been the Practice and Experience of your Parents) to give Mild and Soft Anſwers, for they do often turn away Wrath.</p>
               <p n="7">7. WHATEVER you ſee Virtuous in any, be ſure to follow That; and what you ſee Amiſs in <pb n="5" facs="tcp:191945:3"/>others, diligently ſearch your own Hearts, leſt your Selves be found Guilty thereof; for 'tis an eaſy matter to ſee and find Fault with Another, (moſt can do that) but few love to Examine Themſelves: Be you (my dear

BE not haſty in Reproving or Correcting of any; but if call'd thereto, let it be in Love, and in Wiſdom; and if the Offence be Great, let it be with Severity, yet not in Anger or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for That will Harden them againſt you; and ſo inſtead of bettering them, you will thereby become Tranſgreſſors your ſelves.</p>

               <p n="14">14. BE ſure you have regard to the Oppreſſed, and take heed how you make Advantage of Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Neceſſity, but rather Conſider how you may be Helpful unto them; always remembering the Parable of the good <hi>Samaritan, Luk.</hi> 10.33.</p>
               <p n="15">15. BE Cautious for Whom you are Engag'd, or unto Whom you are Oblig'd; for ſuch things do often prove Snares: But be more ready to Give, than to Receive, and yet be ſure to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the leaſt Kindneſs; for Ingratitude is hateful.</p>
               <p n="16">16. BE not Self-ended; neither ſpend too much upon your own Particulars, either in <hi>Meats, Drinks, Clothing,</hi> or any thing elſe, for That may be a hinderance to the Good you ſhould do; but rather be Sparing in That which relates to your Selves, that you may be in the better capacity to do the Good you ought to perform to Others.</p>
               <p n="17">17. BE not found in many Needleſs Words; neither Contend with ſuch as are in them, for That begets Strife: But as They (out of the Evil that is in their Hearts) bring forth Evil things; ſo do You (out of the Good that is in yours) bring forth Good things.</p>
               <p n="18">18. BE not graſping after Earthly Concerns; for They bring Trouble and Sorrow; and yet, how many, through their Eager Deſires after ſuch things, have choaked that Good, which once
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:191945:5"/>ſtirred in them? Wherefore, take Warning, and learn this as a Truth Experienc'd by Me, that a Little will Satisfy a Contented Mind.</p>
               <p n="19">19. BE not deſirous after that Knowledg, which will lift and puff up your Minds; neither be too Prying into thoſe Myſteries, that are hid; but if the LORD ſhould Reveal any thing unto You, be ſure of Leave, <hi>When,</hi> and to <hi>Whom</hi> to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it, not daring, either to Add, or Diminiſh; for That has been (and is, this Day) a great and ſore Evil.</p>
               <p n="20">20. BUT leſt, through many Words, your Minds ſhould be drawn forth, and (as but too too many have been) hurt thereby, it's with me, to Conclude with thoſe Two Great and Weighty Commandments, <hi>viz..</hi> the Firſt is, <hi>You ſhall Love the LORD with all your Hearts, with all your Souls, and with all your Strength.</hi> And the Second is like unto it, <hi>You ſhall Love your Neighbours as your Selves:</hi> For upon theſe Two Commandments depends All that can be Written, or Spoken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Duties either to GOD or Men.</p>
